## Blind XSS & XSS Hunter

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure />

### What's the difference

- In regular XSS hunting we can see whether or not a payload fires
- WIth Blind XSS we leave payloads like santa leaves presents
- Why? we are hoping they fire on a different page

### What does that mean?

- When we do regular XSS Hunting we can load the page with the xss payload
- But with blind XSS we assume the payload is on the some page we cant see
  - Eg logging functionality, admin control panel, or even a completely different web app
  - We dont know where the payload ends up

### So?

- Standard XSS
  - Try a XSS payload
  - Reload the page.. did it work?
  - No? then try another payload/page
  - yes? 'the report the bug

-Blind XSS

- Send a payload
- Send it to every payload
- Hope that it will fire in some point in the future
- Have a nap
- Eventually get a notification
- report the bug

### What type of XSS

- Our payload gets stored on a sever via a log file or Database
- It's a type of stored XSS
- The main difference between blind XSS and traditional stored XSS?
  - We don’t know where the XSS fires until it fires
  - we don’t know the asset, the url, the api endpoint etc

### Where to find Blnd XSS?

- Focus on endpoint that have some likely admiin interaction
  - 'requires approval', 'requires admin approval' are good signs
  - Product support eg contact us forms, cha applications, support tickets
  - Error messages, anything that migh be saved in a log
  - Reporting functionally, where a comment or post might be revieweed by a moderator
- Bind XSS payloads can often be sprayed to every endpoint
  - Avoid doing this because you might forget where you left

### So what do you need to do this?

- XSS hunter is very popular and commnly used https://xsshunter.com/app (you can run this privately or use the public sevice)
- Alternatives include burp collaborator
- XSS hunter has some neat features
  - It will email you a report
  - Sends the cookies
  - shows a screenshoot
  - and more
