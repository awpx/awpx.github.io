# Awpurl

This is an URL shortener web application that I built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, Node.js)

---

# Demo

You can visit [https://awpurl.onrender.com/](https://awpurl.onrender.com/) to try the app. I deploy it on render.com, and i don't know how long it will up.

_Notice: There is delay about 10 to 30 second for backend to go up when you first time hit the API because render.com will shut down the app if the app not used for 15 minute._

# Preview

# Tech / Tools / Dependencies

- Language/Environtment: `JavaScript, NodeJS`
- Framework: `ExpressJS, ReactJS`
- Database: `MongoDB (mongoose)`
- Styles: `Native CSS`
- Dependencies: `axios, validator, shortid, valid-url`

---

# Features

- Shorten long urls
- Validate url format (backend and frontend)
- Reuse same url stored in database

---

# Motivation

I built this web application as a learning material about implementing the MERN Stack. Even though it is simple, the concept can be learned and understood easily and the application can still run well.

---

# Notes

- Deployed it on render.com, so i don't know how long the demo will up.
- This is juat Demo App, don't abuse it.
