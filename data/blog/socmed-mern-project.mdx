# Awpedia

This is a socmed-like web that I built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, Node.js).

---

# Motivation

I built this web app as a learning material about implementing the MERN Stack (with dummy data), build some reusable component, and maybe as a reference for my other/future project.
