# Restuque/TAP Approval

"Restuque or TAP Approval" is a mobile-based application that is used by PT TAP to manage the approval or permits of a document, proposal, or others with many levels of hierarchical positions and departments.

# Motivation

As soon as I was accepted at the company I was immediately put in a team that would be working on a large project with a fairly short deadline, moreover I was assigned as a mobile developer which at that time I had not mastered yet. I am determined to do my best to build this app while learning and gaining knowledge in a new field. and in the end I managed to finish it on time with good results and my skills also increased.
