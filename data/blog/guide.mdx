## Overview

A post on the new features introduced in v1.0. New features:

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={2} />

First load JS decreased from 43kB to 39kB despite all the new features added!^[With the new changes in Nextjs 12, first load JS increase to 45kB.]

See [upgrade guide](#upgrade-guide) below if you are migrating from v0 version of the template.

## Theme colors

You can easily modify the theme color by changing the primary attribute in the tailwind config file:

```js:tailwind.config.js
theme: {
    colors: {
      primary: colors.teal,
      gray: colors.neutral,
      ...
    }
  ...
}
```

The primary color attribute should be assigned an object with keys from 50, 100, 200 ... 900 and the corresponding color code values.

Tailwind includes great default color palettes that can be used for theming your own website. Check out [customizing colors documentation page](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) for the full range of options.

Migrating from v1? You can revert to the previous theme by setting `primary` to `colors.sky` (Tailwind 2.2.2 and above, otherwise `colors.lightBlue`) and changing gray to `colors.gray`.

From v1.1.2+, you can also customize the style of your code blocks easily by modifying the `css/prism.css` stylesheet. Token classnames are compatible with prismjs
so you can copy and adapt token styles from a prismjs stylesheet e.g. [prism themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).

## Xdm MDX compiler

We switched the MDX bundler from [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) to [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler).
This uses [xdm](https://github.com/wooorm/xdm) under the hood, the latest micromark 3 and remark, rehype libraries.

**Warning:** If you were using custom remark or rehype libraries, please upgrade to micromark 3 compatible ones. If you are upgrading, please delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` to avoid having past dependencies related issues.

[xdm](https://github.com/wooorm/xdm) contains multiple improvements over [@mdx-js/mdx](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), the compiler used internally by next-mdx-remote, but there might be some breaking behaviour changes.
Please check your markdown output to verify.

Some new possibilities include loading components directly in the mdx file using the import syntax and including js code which could be compiled and bundled at the build step.

For example, the following jsx snippet can be used directly in an MDX file to render the page title component:

```jsx
import PageTitle from './PageTitle.js'
;<PageTitle> Using JSX components in MDX </PageTitle>
```

import PageTitle from './PageTitle.js'

<PageTitle> Using JSX components in MDX </PageTitle>

The default configuration resolves all components relative to the `components` directory.

**Note**:
Components which require external image loaders also require additional esbuild configuration.
Components which are dependent on global application state on lifecycle like the Nextjs `Link` component would also not work with this setup as each mdx file is built independently.
For such cases, it is better to use component substitution.

## Table of contents component

Inspired by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/inline-toc) and Gatsby's [gatsby-remark-table-of-contents](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-table-of-contents/),
the `toc` variable containing all the top level headings of the document is passed to the MDX file and can be styled accordingly.
To make generating a table of contents (TOC) simple, you can use the existing `TOCInline` component.

For example, the TOC in this post was generated with the following code:

```jsx
<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={2} />
```

You can customise the headings that are displayed by configuring the `fromHeading` and `toHeading` props, or exclude particular headings
by passing a string or a string array to the `exclude` prop. By default, all headings that are of depth 3 or smaller are indented. This can be configured by changing the `indentDepth` property.
A `asDisclosure` prop can be used to render the TOC within an expandable disclosure element.

Here's the full TOC rendered in a disclosure element.

```jsx
<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure />
```

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure />

## Layouts

You can map mdx blog content to layout components by configuring the frontmatter field. For example, this post is written with the new `PostSimple` layout!

### Adding new templates

layout templates are stored in the `./layouts` folder. You can add your React components that you want to map to markdown content in this folder.
The component file name must match that specified in the markdown frontmatter `layout` field.

The only required field is `children` which contains the rendered MDX content, though you would probably want to pass in the frontMatter contents and render it in the template.

You can configure the template to take in other fields - see `PostLayout` component for an example.

Here's an example layout which you can further customise:

```jsx
export default function ExampleLayout({ frontMatter, children }) {
  const { date, title } = frontMatter

  return (
    <SectionContainer>
      <div>{date}</div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <div>{children}</div>
    </SectionContainer>
  )
}
```

### Configuring a blog post frontmatter

Use the `layout` frontmatter field to specify the template you want to map the markdown post to. Here's how the frontmatter of this post looks like:

```
---
title: 'New features in v1'
date: '2021-05-26   '
tags: ['next-js', 'tailwind', 'guide']
draft: false
summary: 'Introducing the new layout features - you can map mdx blog content to layout components by configuring the frontmatter field'
layout: PostSimple
---
```

You can configure the default layout in the respective page section by modifying the `DEFAULT_LAYOUT` variable.
The `DEFAULT_LAYOUT` for blog posts page is set to `PostLayout`.

### Extend

`layout` is mapped to wrapper which wraps the entire MDX content.

```jsx
export const MDXComponents = {
  Image,
  a: CustomLink,
  pre: Pre,
  wrapper: ({ components, layout, ...rest }) => {
    const Layout = require(`../layouts/${layout}`).default
    return <Layout {...rest} />
  },
}

export const MDXLayoutRenderer = ({ layout, mdxSource, ...rest }) => {
  const MDXLayout = useMemo(() => getMDXComponent(mdxSource), [mdxSource])

  return <MDXLayout layout={layout} components={MDXComponents} {...rest} />
}
```

Use the `MDXLayoutRenderer` component on a page where you want to accept a layout name to map to the desired layout.
You need to pass the layout name from the layout folder (it has to be an exact match).

## Analytics

The template now supports [plausible](https://plausible.io/), [simple analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/) and google analytics.
Configure `siteMetadata.js` with the settings that correspond with the desired analytics provider.

```js
analytics: {
    // supports plausible, simpleAnalytics or googleAnalytics
    plausibleDataDomain: '', // e.g. tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app
    simpleAnalytics: false, // true or false
    googleAnalyticsId: '', // e.g. UA-000000-2 or G-XXXXXXX
  },
```

Custom events are also supported. You can import the `logEvent` function from `@components/analytics/[ANALYTICS-PROVIDER]` file and call it when
triggering certain events of interest. _Note_: Additional configuration might be required depending on the analytics provider, please check their official
documentation for more information.

## Blog comments system

We have also added support for [giscus](https://github.com/laymonage/giscus), [utterances](https://github.com/utterance/utterances) or disqus.
To enable, simply configure `siteMetadata.js` comments property with the desired provider and settings as specified in the config file.

```js
comment: {
    // Select a provider and use the environment variables associated to it
    // https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables
    provider: 'giscus', // supported providers: giscus, utterances, disqus
    giscusConfig: {
      // Visit the link below, and follow the steps in the 'configuration' section
      // https://giscus.app/
      repo: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPO,
      repositoryId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPOSITORY_ID,
      category: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_CATEGORY,
      categoryId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_CATEGORY_ID,
      mapping: 'pathname', // supported options: pathname, url, title
      reactions: '1', // Emoji reactions: 1 = enable / 0 = disable
      // Send discussion metadata periodically to the parent window: 1 = enable / 0 = disable
      metadata: '0',
      // theme example: light, dark, dark_dimmed, dark_high_contrast
      // transparent_dark, preferred_color_scheme, custom
      theme: 'light',
      // theme when dark mode
      darkTheme: 'transparent_dark',
      // If the theme option above is set to 'custom`
      // please provide a link below to your custom theme css file.
      // example: https://giscus.app/themes/custom_example.css
      themeURL: '',
    },
    utterancesConfig: {
      // Visit the link below, and follow the steps in the 'configuration' section
      // https://utteranc.es/
      repo: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_UTTERANCES_REPO,
      issueTerm: '', // supported options: pathname, url, title
      label: '', // label (optional): Comment ðŸ’¬
      // theme example: github-light, github-dark, preferred-color-scheme
      // github-dark-orange, icy-dark, dark-blue, photon-dark, boxy-light
      theme: '',
      // theme when dark mode
      darkTheme: '',
    },
    disqus: {
      // https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717111-what-s-a-shortname
      shortname: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DISQUS_SHORTNAME,
    },
  },
```

## Multiple authors

Information on authors is now split from `siteMetadata.js` and stored in its own `data/authors` folder as a markdown file. Minimally, you will need to have a `default.md` file with authorship information. You can create additional files as required and the file name will be used as the reference to the author.

Here's how an author markdown file might look like:

```md:default.md
---
name: Tails Azimuth
avatar: /static/images/avatar.png
occupation: Professor of Atmospheric Science
company: Stanford University
email: address@yoursite.com
twitter: https://twitter.com/Twitter
linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com
github: https://github.com
---

A long description of yourself...
```

You can use this information in multiple places across the template. For example in the about section of the page, we grab the default author information with this line of code:

```js
const authorDetails = await getFileBySlug('authors', ['default'])
```

This is rendered in the `AuthorLayout` template.

### Multiple authors in blog post

The frontmatter of a blog post accepts an optional `authors` array field. If no field is specified, it is assumed that the default author is used. Simply pass in an array of authors to render multiple authors associated with a post.

For example, the following frontmatter will display the authors given by `data/authors/default.md` and `data/authors/sparrowhawk.md`

```yaml
title: 'My first post'
date: '2021-01-12'
draft: false
summary: 'My first post'
authors: ['default', 'sparrowhawk']
```

A demo of a multiple authors post is shown in [Introducing Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog post](/blog/introducing-tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog).

## Copy button for code blocks

Hover over a code block and you will notice a GitHub-inspired copy button! You can modify `./components/Pre.js` to further customise it.
The component is passed to `MDXComponents` and modifies all `<pre>` blocks.

## Line highlighting and line numbers

Line highlighting and line numbers are now supported out of the box thanks to the new [rehype-prism-plus plugin](https://github.com/timlrx/rehype-prism-plus)

The following javascript code block:

````
```js {1, 3-4} showLineNumbers
var num1, num2, sum
num1 = prompt('Enter first number')
num2 = prompt('Enter second number')
sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2) // "+" means "add"
alert('Sum = ' + sum) // "+" means combine into a string
```
````

will appear as:

```js {1,3-4} showLineNumbers
var num1, num2, sum
num1 = prompt('Enter first number')
num2 = prompt('Enter second number')
sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2) // "+" means "add"
alert('Sum = ' + sum) // "+" means combine into a string
```

To modify the styles, change the following class selectors in the `prism.css` file:

```css
.code-highlight {
  @apply float-left min-w-full;
}

.code-line {
  @apply -mx-4 block border-l-4 border-opacity-0 pl-4 pr-4;
}

.code-line.inserted {
  @apply bg-green-500 bg-opacity-20;
}

.code-line.deleted {
  @apply bg-red-500 bg-opacity-20;
}

.highlight-line {
  @apply -mx-4 border-l-4 border-primary-500 bg-gray-700 bg-opacity-50;
}

.line-number::before {
  @apply mr-4 -ml-2 inline-block w-4 text-right text-gray-400;
  content: attr(line);
}
```

## Newletter component (v1.1.3)

Introduced in v1.1.3, the newsletter component gives you an easy way to build an audience. It integrates with the following providers:

- [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)
- [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/)
- [Convertkit](https://convertkit.com/)

To use it, specify the provider which you are using in the config file and add the necessary environment variables to the `.env` file.
For more information on the required variables, check out `.env.sample.`

Two components are exported, a default `NewsletterForm` and a `BlogNewsletterForm` component, which is also passed in as an MDX component
and can be used in a blog post:

```jsx
<BlogNewsletterForm title="Like what you are reading?" />
```

<BlogNewsletterForm title="Like what you are reading?" />

The component relies on nextjs's [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) which requires a server-side instance of nextjs to be setup
and is not compatible with a 100% static site export. Users should either self-host or use a compatible platform like Vercel or Netlify which supports this functionality.

A static site compatible alternative is to substitute the route in the newsletter component with a form API endpoint provider.

## Bibliography and Citations (v1.2.1)

`rehype-citation` plugin is added to the xdm processing pipeline in v1.2.1. This allows you to easily format citations and insert bibliography from an existing bibtex or CSL-json file.

For example, the following markdown code sample:

```md
Standard citation [@Nash1950]
In-text citations e.g. @Nash1951
Multiple citations [see @Nash1950; @Nash1951, page 50]

**References:**

[^ref]
```

is rendered to the following:

Standard citation [@Nash1950]  
In-text citations e.g. @Nash1951  
Multiple citations [see @Nash1950; @Nash1951, page 50]

**References:**

[^ref]

A bibliography will be inserted at the end of the document, but this can be overwritten by specifying a `[^Ref]` tag at the intended location.
The plugin uses APA citation formation, but also supports the following CSLs, 'apa', 'vancouver', 'harvard1', 'chicago', 'mla', or a path to a user-specified CSL file.

See [rehype-citation readme](https://github.com/timlrx/rehype-citation) for more information on the configuration options.

## Self-hosted font (v1.5.0)

Google font has been replaced with self-hosted font from [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/). This gives the following [advantages](https://fontsource.org/docs/introduction):

> Self-hosting brings significant performance gains as loading fonts from hosted services, such as Google Fonts, lead to an extra (render blocking) network request. To provide perspective, for simple websites it has been seen to double visual load times.
>
> Fonts remain version locked. Google often pushes updates to their fonts without notice, which may interfere with your live production projects. Manage your fonts like any other NPM dependency.
>
> Commit to privacy. Google does track the usage of their fonts and for those who are extremely privacy concerned, self-hosting is an alternative.

This leads to a smaller font bundle and a 0.1s faster load time ([webpagetest comparison](https://www.webpagetest.org/video/compare.php?tests=220201_AiDcFH_f68a69b758454dd52d8e67493fdef7da,220201_BiDcMC_bf2d53f14483814ba61e794311dfa771)).

To change the default Inter font:

1. Install the preferred [font](https://fontsource.org/fonts) - `npm install -save @fontsource/<font-name>`
2. Update the import at `pages/_app.js`- `import '@fontsource/<font-name>.css'`
3. Update the `fontfamily` property in the tailwind css config file

## Images

The tailwind starter blog has out of the box support for [Next.js's built-in image component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) and automatically swaps out default image tags in markdown or mdx documents to use the Image component provided.

### Usage

To use in a new page route / javascript file, simply import the image component and call it e.g.

```js
import Image from 'next/image'

function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>My Homepage</h1>
      <Image src="/me.png" alt="Picture of the author" width={500} height={500} />
      <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>
    </>
  )
}

export default Home
```

For a markdown file, the default image tag can be used and the default `img` tag gets replaced by the `Image` component in the build process.

Assuming we have a file called `ocean.jpg` in `data/img/ocean.jpg`, the following line of code would generate the optimized image.

```
![ocean](/static/images/ocean.webp)
```

Alternatively, since we are using mdx, we can just use the image component directly! Note, that you would have to provide a fixed width and height. The `img` tag method parses the dimension automatically.

```js
<Image alt="ocean" src="/static/images/ocean.jpg" width={256} height={128} />
```

_Note_: If you try to save the image, it is in webp format, if your browser supports it!

1280 x 720 image ocean

![ocean](/static/images/ocean.webp)

1280 x 720 image oce

![oce](/static/images/oce.webp)

720 x ... image ocea

![ocea](/static/images/ocea.webp)

### Benefits

- Smaller image size with Webp (~30% smaller than jpeg)
- Responsive images - the correct image size is served based on the user's viewport
- Lazy loading - images load as they are scrolled to the viewport
- Avoids [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/)
- Optimization on demand instead of build-time - no increase in build time!

### Limitations

- Due to the reliance on `next/image`, unless you are using an external image CDN like Cloudinary or Imgix, it is practically required to use Vercel for hosting. This is because the component acts like a serverless function that calls a highly optimized image CDN.

  If you do not want to be tied to Vercel, you can remove `imgToJsx` in `remarkPlugins` in `lib/mdx.js`. This would avoid substituting the default `img` tag.

  Alternatively, one could wait for image optimization at build time to be supported. A different library, [next-optimized-images](https://github.com/cyrilwanner/next-optimized-images) does that, although it requires transforming the images through webpack which is not done here.

- Images from external links are not passed through `next/image`
- All images have to be stored in the `public` folder e.g `/static/images/ocean.jpeg`

## Gallery Example (O Canada)

The scenic lands of Canada featuring maple leaves, snow-capped mountains, turquoise lakes and Toronto. Take in the sights in this photo gallery exhibition and see how easy it is to replicate with some MDX magic and tailwind classes.

Features images served using `next/image` component. The locally stored images are located in a folder with the following path: `/static/images/canada/[filename].jpg`

Since we are using mdx, we can create a simple responsive flexbox grid to display our images with a few tailwind css classes.

### Gallery

<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  <div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden px-2 xl:my-1 xl:w-1/2 xl:px-2">
    ![Maple](/static/images/canada/maple.jpg)
  </div>
  <div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden px-2 xl:my-1 xl:w-1/2 xl:px-2">
    ![Lake](/static/images/canada/lake.jpg)
  </div>
  <div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden px-2 xl:my-1 xl:w-1/2 xl:px-2">
    ![Mountains](/static/images/canada/mount.webp)
  </div>
  <div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden px-2 xl:my-1 xl:w-1/2 xl:px-2">
    ![Toronto](/static/images/canada/toronto.jpg)
  </div>
</div>

### Implementation

```js
<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  <div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden px-2 xl:my-1 xl:w-1/2 xl:px-2">
    ![Maple](/static/images/canada/maple.jpg)
  </div>
  <div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden px-2 xl:my-1 xl:w-1/2 xl:px-2">
    ![Lake](/static/images/canada/lake.jpg)
  </div>
  <div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden px-2 xl:my-1 xl:w-1/2 xl:px-2">
    ![Mountains](/static/images/canada/mount.webp)
  </div>
  <div className="my-1 w-full overflow-hidden px-2 xl:my-1 xl:w-1/2 xl:px-2">
    ![Toronto](/static/images/canada/toronto.jpg)
  </div>
</div>
```

With MDX v2, one can interleave markdown in jsx as shown in the example code.

### Quick Start Guide

1. Try installing the starter using the new [Pliny project CLI](https://github.com/timlrx/pliny):

```bash
npm i -g @pliny/cli
pliny new --template=starter-blog my-blog
```

It supports the updated version of the blog with Contentlayer, optional choice of TS/JS and different package managers as well as more modularized components which will be the basis of the template going forward.

Alternatively to stick with the current version, TypeScript and Contentlayer:

```bash
npx degit 'timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog#contentlayer'
```

or JS (official support)

```bash
npx degit https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.git
```

2. Personalize `siteMetadata.js` (site related information)
3. Modify the content security policy in `next.config.js` if you want to use
   any analytics provider or a commenting solution other than giscus.
4. Personalize `authors/default.md` (main author)
5. Modify `projectsData.js`
6. Modify `headerNavLinks.js` to customize navigation links
7. Add blog posts
8. Deploy on Vercel

### Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Extend / Customize

`data/siteMetadata.js` - contains most of the site related information which should be modified for a user's need.

`data/authors/default.md` - default author information (required). Additional authors can be added as files in `data/authors`.

`data/projectsData.js` - data used to generate styled card on the projects page.

`data/headerNavLinks.js` - navigation links.

`data/logo.svg` - replace with your own logo.

`data/blog` - replace with your own blog posts.

`public/static` - store assets such as images and favicons.

`tailwind.config.js` and `css/tailwind.css` - contain the tailwind stylesheet which can be modified to change the overall look and feel of the site.

`css/prism.css` - controls the styles associated with the code blocks. Feel free to customize it and use your preferred prismjs theme e.g. [prism themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).

`components/social-icons` - to add other icons, simply copy an svg file from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) and map them in `index.js`. Other icons use [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).

`components/MDXComponents.js` - pass your own JSX code or React component by specifying it over here. You can then call them directly in the `.mdx` or `.md` file. By default, a custom link and image component is passed.

`layouts` - main templates used in pages.

`pages` - pages to route to. Read the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for more information.

`next.config.js` - configuration related to Next.js. You need to adapt the Content Security Policy if you want to load scripts, images etc. from other domains.

### Post Frontmatter

Frontmatter follows [Hugo's standards](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).

Currently 7 fields are supported.

```
title (required)
date (required)
tags (required, can be empty array)
lastmod (optional)
draft (optional)
summary (optional)
images (optional, if none provided defaults to socialBanner in siteMetadata config)
authors (optional list which should correspond to the file names in `data/authors`. Uses `default` if none is specified)
layout (optional list which should correspond to the file names in `data/layouts`)
canonicalUrl (optional, canonical url for the post for SEO)
```

Here's an example of a post's frontmatter:

```
---
title: 'Introducing Tailwind Nexjs Starter Blog'
date: '2021-01-12'
lastmod: '2021-01-18'
tags: ['next-js', 'tailwind', 'guide']
draft: false
summary: 'Looking for a performant, out of the box template, with all the best in web technology to support your blogging needs? Checkout the Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog template.'
images: ['/static/images/canada/mountains.jpg', '/static/images/canada/toronto.jpg']
authors: ['default', 'anonim']
layout: PostLayout
canonicalUrl: https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog/introducing-tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog
---
```

### Compose

Run `node ./scripts/compose.js` to bootstrap a new post.

Follow the interactive prompt to generate a post with pre-filled front matter.

### Deploy

**Vercel**  
The easiest way to deploy the template is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com) from the creators of Next.js. Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

**Netlify / GitHub Pages / Firebase etc.**  
As the template uses `next/image` for image optimization, additional configurations have to be made to deploy on other popular static hosting websites like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). An alternative image optimization provider such as Imgix, Cloudinary or Akamai has to be used. Alternatively, replace the `next/image` component with a standard `<img>` tag. See [`next/image` documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) for more details.

The API routes used in the newsletter component cannot be used in a static site export. You will need to use a form API endpoint provider and substitute the route in the newsletter component accordingly. Other hosting platforms such as Netlify also offer alternative solutions - please refer to their docs for more information.

## Upgrade guide

There are significant portions of the code that has been changed from v0 to v1 including support for layouts and a new mdx engine.

There's also no real reason to change if the previous one serves your needs and it might be easier to copy
the component changes you are interested in to your existing blog rather than migrating everything over.

Nonetheless, if you want to do so and have not changed much of the template, you could clone the new version and copy over the blog post over to the new template.

Another alternative would be to pull the latest template version with the following code:

```bash
git remote add template git@github.com:timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.git
git pull template v1 --allow-unrelated-histories
rm -rf node_modules
```

You can see an example of such a migration in this [commit](https://github.com/timlrx/timlrx.com/commit/bba1c185384fd6d5cdaac15abf802fdcff027286) for my personal blog.

v1 also uses `feed.xml` rather than `index.xml`, to avoid some build issues with Vercel. If you are migrating you should add a redirect to `next.config.js` like so:

```js
async redirects() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/:path/index.xml',
      destination: '/:path/feed.xml',
      permanent: true,
    }
  ]
}
```

## Mathematical

Parsing and display of math equations is included in this blog template. Parsing of math is enabled by `remark-math` and `rehype-katex`.
KaTeX and its associated font is included in `_document.js` so feel free to use it on any page.
^[For the full list of supported TeX functions, check out the [KaTeX documentation](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html)]

Inline math symbols can be included by enclosing the term between the `$` symbol.

Math code blocks are denoted by `$$`.

If you intend to use the `$` sign instead of math, you can escape it (`\$`), or specify the HTML entity (`&dollar;`) [^2]

Inline or manually enumerated footnotes are also supported. Click on the links above to see them in action.

[^2]: \$10 and &dollar;20.

### Deriving the OLS Estimator

Using matrix notation, let $n$ denote the number of observations and $k$ denote the number of regressors.

The vector of outcome variables $\mathbf{Y}$ is a $n \times 1$ matrix,

```tex
\mathbf{Y} = \left[\begin{array}
  {c}
  y_1 \\
  . \\
  . \\
  . \\
  y_n
\end{array}\right]
```

$$
\mathbf{Y} = \left[\begin{array}
  {c}
  y_1 \\
  . \\
  . \\
  . \\
  y_n
\end{array}\right]
$$

The matrix of regressors $\mathbf{X}$ is a $n \times k$ matrix (or each row is a $k \times 1$ vector),

```latex
\mathbf{X} = \left[\begin{array}
  {ccccc}
  x_{11} & . & . & . & x_{1k} \\
  . & . & . & . & .  \\
  . & . & . & . & .  \\
  . & . & . & . & .  \\
  x_{n1} & . & . & . & x_{nn}
\end{array}\right] =
\left[\begin{array}
  {c}
  \mathbf{x}'_1 \\
  . \\
  . \\
  . \\
  \mathbf{x}'_n
\end{array}\right]
```

$$
\mathbf{X} = \left[\begin{array}
  {ccccc}
  x_{11} & . & . & . & x_{1k} \\
  . & . & . & . & .  \\
  . & . & . & . & .  \\
  . & . & . & . & .  \\
  x_{n1} & . & . & . & x_{nn}
\end{array}\right] =
\left[\begin{array}
  {c}
  \mathbf{x}'_1 \\
  . \\
  . \\
  . \\
  \mathbf{x}'_n
\end{array}\right]
$$

The vector of error terms $\mathbf{U}$ is also a $n \times 1$ matrix.

At times it might be easier to use vector notation. For consistency, I will use the bold small x to denote a vector and capital letters to denote a matrix. Single observations are denoted by the subscript.

### Least Squares

**Start**:  
$$y_i = \mathbf{x}'_i \beta + u_i$$

**Assumptions**:

1. Linearity (given above)
2. $E(\mathbf{U}|\mathbf{X}) = 0$ (conditional independence)
3. rank($\mathbf{X}$) = $k$ (no multi-collinearity i.e. full rank)
4. $Var(\mathbf{U}|\mathbf{X}) = \sigma^2 I_n$ (Homoskedascity)

**Aim**:  
Find $\beta$ that minimises the sum of squared errors:

$$
Q = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{u_i^2} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{(y_i - \mathbf{x}'_i\beta)^2}
= (Y-X\beta)'(Y-X\beta)
$$

**Solution**:  
Hints: $Q$ is a $1 \times 1$ scalar, by symmetry $\frac{\partial b'Ab}{\partial b} = 2Ab$.

Take matrix derivative w.r.t $\beta$:

```tex
\begin{aligned}
  \min Q           & = \min_{\beta} \mathbf{Y}'\mathbf{Y} - 2\beta'\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{Y} +
  \beta'\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X}\beta \\
                   & = \min_{\beta} - 2\beta'\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{Y} + \beta'\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X}\beta \\
  \text{[FOC]}~~~0 & =  - 2\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{Y} + 2\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X}\hat{\beta}                  \\
  \hat{\beta}      & = (\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{Y}                              \\
                   & = (\sum^{n} \mathbf{x}_i \mathbf{x}'_i)^{-1} \sum^{n} \mathbf{x}_i y_i
\end{aligned}
```

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \min Q           & = \min_{\beta} \mathbf{Y}'\mathbf{Y} - 2\beta'\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{Y} +
  \beta'\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X}\beta \\
                   & = \min_{\beta} - 2\beta'\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{Y} + \beta'\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X}\beta \\
  \text{[FOC]}~~~0 & =  - 2\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{Y} + 2\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X}\hat{\beta}                  \\
  \hat{\beta}      & = (\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{Y}                              \\
                   & = (\sum^{n} \mathbf{x}_i \mathbf{x}'_i)^{-1} \sum^{n} \mathbf{x}_i y_i
\end{aligned}
$$

## Markdown Guide

Markdown and Mdx parsing is supported via `unified`, and other remark and rehype packages. `next-mdx-remote` allows us to parse `.mdx` and `.md` files in a more flexible manner without touching webpack.

GitHub flavored markdown is used. `mdx-prism` provides syntax highlighting capabilities for code blocks. Here's a demo of how everything looks.

The following markdown cheatsheet is adapted from: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

Hereâ€™s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files.

### Headers

```
# This is a h1 tag

## This is a h2 tag

#### This is a h4 tag
```

```
_This text will be italic_

**This text will be bold**

_You **can** combine them_
```

- Lists

### Unordered

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b
```

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b

### Ordered

```
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b
```

1. Item 1

### Syntax highlighting

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use syntax highlighting with [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/):

````
```js:fancyAlert.js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' })
  }
}
```
````

And here's how it looks - nicely colored with styled code titles!

```js:fancyAlert.js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' })
  }
}
```

- Footnotes

```
Here is a simple footnote[^1]. With some additional text after it.

- Task Lists

```
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
```

- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

- Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

```
| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |
```

| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |

- Any word wrapped with two tildes (like `~~this~~`) will appear ~~crossed out~~.
