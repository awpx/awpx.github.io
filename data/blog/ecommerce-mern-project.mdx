# A Shop

This is a E-commerce web app that I built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, Node.js).

---

# Motivation

I built this web app as a portfolio project back in 2020/2021 and also for learning material about implementing the MERN Stack, build some reusable component, and maybe as a reference for my other/future project.
